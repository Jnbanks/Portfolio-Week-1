# Portfolio-Week-1

User Story
AS A Job Seeker
I WANT to provide a clean and functional portfolio
SO THAT I can showcase my projects to companies looking to hire someone with my qualifications

```
GIVEN An employer needs to see my work
WHEN they load my portfolio
THEN they are presented with my name, photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN they click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN they click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my projects
WHEN they are presented with the my first application
THEN that application's image is larger in size than the others
WHEN they click on the images of the applications
THEN they are taken to that deployed application
WHEN they resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN they are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to their viewport
